<h1>C++ Language Slack Workspace</h1>

This is a multi-channel chat environment which gathers people
using C++ worldwide, into the same place so we can all learn
from each other. It is like IRC but with modern clients that
support multimedia, notifications, and smart devices.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Why do you need my e-mail?</b></p><p>
  Slack is invite based. Your e-mail address is used to register you
  in the workspace. The invitation tool does not store your address.
  </p></li>

<li><p><b>Who operates this Slack workspace?</b></p><p>
  This workspace is paid for and operated in public by The C++ Alliance
  in accordance with its mission to promote the general welfare of the
  C++ programming language.
  </p></li>

<li><p><b>What are the rules?</b></p><p>
  Behavior should remain relatively professional in public channels,
  as people from all over the world meet here to discuss C++ topics.
  We ask that you follow the Code of Conduct.
  </p></li>

<li><p><b>How are the rules enforced?</b></p><p>
  Due to the sheer size of the community, it is not practical for
  admins to police every channel all the time. When you see a user
  acting badly, consider letting them know in a nice way. Give a
  benefit of the doubt generously, as spirited debate is sometimes
  mistaken for bad behavior.</p><p>
  If diplomacy fails and disruptions persist, please contact
  <a href="https://cpplang.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins">one of the admins</a>
  privately and state the nature of the problem.
  </p></li>

</ul>

<li><p><b>Friendly cooperation</b></p><p>

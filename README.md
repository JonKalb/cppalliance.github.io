# Mission

The C++ Alliance is a California non-profit 501(c)(3) (pending)
organization whose primary function is to advance C++ by
developing open source libraries.

The mission of the C++ Alliance is to empower C++ programmers by
building a better C++ programming environment with such activities
as: supporting the work of the ISO Standard Committee by improving
the core language and standard library, supporting the creation and
distribution of open source C++ libraries, developing, communicating,
and promoting the use of C++ best practices, and supporting the
creation and use of better tools and standards for building and
working with C++ source code. The Alliance will achieve this by
supporting individuals and organizations that are working toward
these goals through both direct and indirect action or funding.
The support may take any of several forms. For example, the
Alliance will employ software engineers to create key open
sources libraries or tools. The Alliance may give travel
grants to events such ISO Standards Committee meetings,
conferences, or other C++ related events. It may offer
prizes to the individual or group of individuals that
accomplish a specific goal. It may give sponsorships
or other indirect support to conferences or other
organizations with overlapping goals.

## Activities

The organization achieves its mission through these means:

* Fund open source libraries
* Organize and support C++ conferences and community activities
* Support and promote WG21 proceedings
* Provide C++ education

## Our Vision

Mankind has become increasingly reliant on software for all aspects
of life including commerce, industry, recreation, transportation,
communication, and more. We believe that the best software solutions
are written using the C++ programming language. We believe that
software and knowledge are best developed and published using the
"open source" model: software for which the original source code
is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified
without restriction.

Our organization is dedicated to helping C++ evolve not only through
the language specification but also through the ecosystem of open
source libraries and talented individuals who make open source
contributions.

## Our Team

and individuals, and advises the board on technical and social
topics related to C++.

Glen Fernandes

Glen Joseph Fernandes has worked at Intel and Microsoft as a
Software Engineer. He is the author of the Boost Align library,
a major contributor the the Boost Smart Pointers and Boost Core
libraries, and has also contributed to several other Boost C++
libraries. He is a contributor to the ISO C++ Standard by authoring
proposal papers and defect reports, and has two features accepted
for the upcoming C++20 standard (P0673R1, P0653R2). He lives with
his wife, Caroline, and daughter, Aeryn, in the US, graduated from
the University of Sydney, Australia, and before all that, lived in
New Zealand.

## Advisors

Jens Weller

Jens Weller is the organizer and founder of Meeting C++. Doing C++
since 1998, he is an active member of the C++ Community. From being
a moderator at c-plusplus.de and organizer of his own C++ User Group
since 2011 in Düsseldorf, his roots are in the C++ Community. Today
his main work is running the Meeting C++ Platform (conference, website,
social media and recruiting). His main role has become being a C++
evangelist, as this he speaks and travels to other conferences and user
groups around the world.

## FAQ

Q) Given the existence of Standard C++ Foundation and Software Freedom Conservancy, why was it necessary to form The C++ Alliance as a new, separate legal entity?

A) Although the missions of Standard C++ Foundation and The C++ Alliance are similar and overlapping, they have different status under tax law. The Foundation is organized as a 501(c)(6) organization, a trade group. In addition to providing legal protection for companies to work together in ways that might otherwise be viewed as industrial "collusion," a trade group can accept tax-deductible dues from member companies. The Alliance is organized as a 501(c)(3) organization, a charity which can accept tax deductible contributes from the general public.

Although the tax status of Software Freedom Conservancy and The C++ Alliance are similar, their missions and concerns are different. There is mission overlap. Conservancy, whose mission is to support the development of FLOSS libraries supports the Boost Libraries project, which would also be within the mission of The Alliance, but The Alliance has both a narrower and a broader mission. While Conservancy is language agnostic and is focused on software development, The Alliance is focused exclusively on the C++ environment and is free to support non-FLOSS projects such as language proposals, books, education materials, tools, or other projects which may not be software or may have non-FLOSS licensing.

It is also the case that The C++ Alliance is not a good fit as a Conservancy project. It is appropriate for small open-source projects to pool their resources to provide themselves with financial, legal, accounting, and other services for which they have a common need and for which they may, individually, be too small to economically procure. Although The Alliance will be promoting library development, it doesn't have the same requirements as a FLOSS software producer, so would need different services than your typical Conservancy project and has sufficient endowment to fund the services that it will require.

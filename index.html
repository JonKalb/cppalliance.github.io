<h1>Mission</h1>

<p>
The C++ Alliance is a California non-profit 501(c)(3) (pending)
organization whose primary function is to advance C++ by
developing open source libraries.
</p>
<p>
The mission of the C++ Alliance is to empower C++ programmers by
building a better C++ programming environment with such activities
as: supporting the work of the ISO Standard Committee by improving
the core language and standard library, supporting the creation and
distribution of open source C++ libraries, developing, communicating,
and promoting the use of C++ best practices, and supporting the
creation and use of better tools and standards for building and
working with C++ source code. The Alliance will achieve this by
supporting individuals and organizations that are working toward
these goals through both direct and indirect action or funding.
The support may take any of several forms. For example, the
Alliance will employ software engineers to create key open
sources libraries or tools. The Alliance may give travel
grants to events such ISO Standards Committee meetings,
conferences, or other C++ related events. It may offer
prizes to the individual or group of individuals that
accomplish a specific goal. It may give sponsorships
or other indirect support to conferences or other
organizations with overlapping goals.
</p>

<h1>Vision</h1>

<p>
Mankind has become increasingly reliant on software for all aspects
of life including commerce, industry, recreation, transportation,
communication, and more. We believe that the best software solutions
are written using the C++ programming language. We believe that
software and knowledge are best developed and published using the
"open source" model: software for which the original source code
is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified
without restriction.
</p>
<p>
Our organization is dedicated to helping C++ evolve not only through
the language specification but also through the ecosystem of open
source libraries and talented individuals who make open source
contributions.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>
    Given the existence of Standard C++ Foundation and Software Freedom
    Conservancy, why was it necessary to form The C++ Alliance as a new,
    separate legal entity?</b></p>
    <p>
    Although the missions of Standard C++ Foundation and The C++ Alliance are
    similar and overlapping, they have different status under tax law. The
    Foundation is organized as a 501(c)(6) organization, a trade group. In
    addition to providing legal protection for companies to work together in
    ways that might otherwise be viewed as industrial "collusion," a trade
    group can accept tax-deductible dues from member companies. The Alliance
    is organized as a 501(c)(3) organization, a charity which can accept tax
    deductible contributions from the general public.
    </p><p>
    While the tax status of Software Freedom Conservancy and the Alliance
    are similar, their missions and concerns are different. There is mission
    overlap. Conservancy, whose mission is to support the development of
    FLOSS libraries supports the Boost Libraries project, which would also
    be within the mission of The Alliance, but The Alliance has both a
    narrower and a broader mission. While Conservancy
    is language agnostic and is focused on software development, The Alliance
    is focused exclusively on the C++ environment and is free to support
    non-FLOSS projects such as language proposals, books, education materials,
    tools, or other projects which may not be software or may have non-FLOSS
    licensing.
    </p><p>
    It is also the case that The C++ Alliance is not a good fit as a
    Conservancy project. It is appropriate for small open-source projects
    to pool their resources to provide themselves with financial, legal,
    accounting, and other services for which they have a common need and
    for which they may, individually, be too small to economically procure.
    Although The Alliance will be promoting library development, it doesn't
    have the same requirements as a FLOSS software producer, so would need
    different services than your typical Conservancy project and has
    sufficient endowment to fund the services that it will require.
